# RESRGAN-16xre-upscale-HD-texture-pack
a texture pack for super mario 64 that is made of a compillation of the best results esrgan could make as well of various other improvements made by me or one of my contributors
so for the last couple of days i've been working on my own deviation from the official upscaled texture pack over at the discord server, the aim and focus from each of these is very different, the original upscale pack goal being to upscale and using those upscales as a base to tweak them into something even closer to the original while my goal with this pack aims to do something simpler and serves more as a compilation of many AI upscaling methods and models available within esrgan.

to go into more detail with the resrgan upscale texture pack i aimed to find among the many different methods and models
that esrgan offered me once the upscales were done the best results available and from each model would be selected and then i just made very basic but essential tweaks like making sure the textures looked good in game by removing seams or artifacts from every picture that was included and if i couldn't get a texture to look better than the results already available on the pre existing upscaled texture pack i would just use that instead but don't worry both of these texture packs are vastly different from each other and if you already downloaded one don't get discouraged because of it each texture pack offers extremely different experiences from one and other.

the reason some very small percentage of the original upscaled textures are still available in mine is because that pack served as both base and inspiration and if it weren't for the help and advice i received along the way this pack wouldn't exist.

if you are interested at having a closer look at how i made this here's a link to all of the upscales i made and chose from, be adviced this is a very heavy file (5.5gb):https://mega.nz/file/lGBVESob#dlD1QRD7- ... YHpONmo43c
